# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  The Interactive 3D Vision & Learning Lab (IVL) led by Srinath Sridhar, part of Brown Visual Computing, works on 3D computer vision and machine learning problems to better understand how humans interact with the world. Our research spans 3D spatiotemporal visual understanding objects, humans in motion, and human-object interactions.
